    <h3>About us</h3>
    <p>As an initiative formed by public research institutions, DiSSCo is committed to Open Science. We believe that
        Open Science not only makes the scientific work more transparent and accessible but also enables a whole new set
        of collaborative and IT-based scientific methods. Therefore, the outputs of our common research projects are
        openly available as much as possible in the DiSSCo-Knowledgebase</p>

    <p>The Knowledgebase content is organized around <strong>Projects</strong> which are represented by DiSSCo-linked
        projects (ICEDIG, Synthesys+, and DiSSCo Prepare). Within each Project there can be an unlimited number of
        <strong>Clusters</strong> Each cluster may contain an unlimited number of items with the outputs.</p>

        ICEDIG. The outputs are stored in Projects and its Clusters</p>
