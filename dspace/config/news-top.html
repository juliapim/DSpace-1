<h3>Transparent and accessible</h3>
<p>This is the DiSSCo-Knowledgebase hub. We are committed to Open Science and believe that Open Science not only makes the scientific work more transparent and accessible but also enables a whole new set of collaborative and IT-based scientific methods. This means that the outputs of our common research projects are openly available as much as possible. To make this access to our research outputs not only theoretical but very convenient for you, we have stored them all in one place.
